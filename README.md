# portfolio

Project-brief: This project was about building my portfolio to show the projects i have done from a given design in Figma. The job was mainly done in html and css. The aim of the project was also to practice accessibiliy with screenreading, and validate the site.

Everything is build from scratch, and the biggest part was to have control in css. I have practiced on css structure and allowed myself to create more classes then ever. The most challanging part for me is to keep a structure with good class variables. I think this was a good project to try out the css and html skill.
